<div id="main">
<p>Welcome to the Social Dynamics lab homepage. The labs are designed to introduce the basics of
using the web for studying social dynamics. Its chief goal is to raise your degree of programming literacy so you can start experimenting with big-data questions.</p>
<br>

<h4>Lab One</h4><p class="desc">The labs begin with the user's Facebook data as an example network for thinking about processes through which
outcomes (e.g. social capital) might be produced. For students who don't actively use Facebook, a real anonymized
 network is provided.</p>
<h4>Lab Two</h4> <p class="desc">The second lab then turns to text scraping from Craigslist.</p>
<h4>Lab Three</h4> <p class="desc">The third and final lab uses Twitter to combine the elements of network analysis
and text scraping to begin to ask questions about flow of information and ideas. More details to follow.</p><br><br><br><br>
<b>Get Started &#10145;</b> To get started with the labs go the <a href="Getting_started.html"><font color="0000FF">Getting Started</font></a> page.

<p><font size="1.5">This project was originally funded by a small grant from the University of Michigan's Sociology Department; it was sustained and expanded with support from the University of Michigan's Third Century Initiative</font></p>
