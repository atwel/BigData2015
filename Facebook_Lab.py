""" Facebook Lab for Social Dynamics package

This module is for the Social Dynamics Facebook lab (jonatwell.com/lab). It uses your Facebook data and helps
you augment those with your intimate knowledge about your relationships. You can then plot your network, color it
by a variety of attributes and do measurements on it. 

It uses the Facebook.py SDK (copyright Facebook) to connect to the Facebook graph and lets you do the authentication
 to Facebook so as to make sure your password is not leaked.

It also uses the awesome open-source libraries that are IPython, Pandas, NetworkX and Matplotlib.

It is designed to be run using an IPython notebook (version 1.1.0 and greater) and therefore implements 
the database using Pandas which has been integrated into the Notebooks platform. 

Finally, development of this lab was supported with a curriculum development grant from the Department of Sociology
at the University of Michigan.
